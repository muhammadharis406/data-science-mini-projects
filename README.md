This repository contains my practice projects in Data Science. I am currently learning with Python, Pandas, and NumPy using VS Code as my development environment. These projects are part of my journey to improve my skills step by step.

Right now, I am focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and simple visualizations. In the future, I plan to add more projects as I learn Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, Machine Learning, and other data science tools.

The main goal of this repo is to track my learning progress and create a collection of small but useful projects that show my growth in the field of Data Science.
